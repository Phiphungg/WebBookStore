WebBookStore Project Description

This is an online bookshop. This project was created by the servlet java language, which uses the bootstrap framework, javaScript and mysql. 
This site is for people who buy books online and is managed by an admin. The project has common and proprietary operating functions for the admin and the user.

For admin, the site is equipped with CRUD functionality with all products (books). In addition, the admin can also track the user's orders, the number of subscribers and the total number of products that the admin has added to the site.

For users, the site is equipped with an authenticated account registration via Google email. Users can log in to the site with their registered account and perform product purchases.

The site equips users with product CRUD functionality to the cart, showing the total number of products already in the cart. There's a checkout function on that side to confirm the purchase. You can then review all your purchases in the "My Orders" section.

For general operations, the admin and the user can change their profiles in the "Edit Profile" section and change their passwords in the “Edit Password” section. It can also search for products in the search bar or a quick search in the category list bar.

Additionally, the site also reports errors when an admin or user performs the wrong operation. For example, when registering an account, if you register with an existing username, enter missing information, enter the wrong password, re-enter the password, you will be notified and re-registered.  And for CRUD operations, password change, profile change will also be notified.


This is all the descriptive information about this site.
Thank you for reading and watching my project.
